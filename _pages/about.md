I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Agricultural and Resource Economics department at the University of California, Davis.

As an environmental and natural resource economist, I evaluate land-use practices and environmental policies designed to mitigate the impacts of climate change and environmental degradation. My dissertation examines how prescribed burns and mechanical biomass removals—commonly known as fuel treatments—reduce the economic costs of wildfires. In this work, I emphasize the importance of aligning environmental policies, such as the Northwest Forest Plan, with broader ecosystem management goals in the face of a changing climate. Expanding on my dissertation research, I recently secured a CAL FIRE grant to investigate how fuel treatments on public lands affect the values and incentives of neighboring private landowners.

Before joining UC Davis, I earned my M.A. in economics from the University of Southern California and a B.A. in economics and psychology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 

I am actively seeking academic positions during the 2024-25 academic year. You can reach me at **ftstrabo@ucdavis.edu**
