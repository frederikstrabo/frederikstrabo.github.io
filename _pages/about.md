I am a Postdoctoral scholar in the Agricultural and Resource Economics department at the University of California, Davis.

As an environmental and natural resource economist, I evaluate land-use practices and environmental policies designed to mitigate the impacts of climate change and environmental degradation. My dissertation examines how prescribed burns and mechanical biomass removals—commonly known as fuel treatments—reduce the economic costs of wildfires. In this work, I emphasize the importance of aligning environmental policies, such as the Northwest Forest Plan, with broader ecosystem management goals in the face of a changing climate. Expanding on my dissertation research, I recently secured a CAL FIRE grant to investigate how fuel treatments on public lands affect the values and incentives of neighboring private landowners.

I earned my Ph.D. in Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC Davis, my M.A. in Economics from the University of Southern California, and my B.A. in Economics and Psychology from the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

In May 2026, I will join the Department of Resource Economics and Environmental Sociology at the University of Alberta as an Assistant Professor. You can reach me at **ftstrabo@ucdavis.edu**.
