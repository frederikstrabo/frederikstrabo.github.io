I am a Postdoctoral scholar in the Agricultural and Resource Economics department at the University of California, Davis.

As an environmental and natural resource economist, I study how land-use practices and environmental policies can mitigate the impacts of climate change and environmental degradation. My dissertation focuses on wildfire management, combining causal inference methods with high-resolution spatial data to show that fuel treatments such as prescribed burns and mechanical biomass removals generate substantial economic returns by reducing suppression costs, property loss, and smoke-related health impacts. I also examine how conservation policies and regulatory reforms shape forest management decisions, underscoring the trade-offs between ecosystem protection and climate resilience. Building on this work, I recently received a CAL FIRE grant to study how fuel treatments on public lands affect the values and incentives of neighboring private landowners.

I earned my Ph.D. in Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC Davis, my M.A. in Economics from the University of Southern California, and my B.A. in Economics and Psychology from the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison.

In May 2026, I will join the Department of Resource Economics and Environmental Sociology at the University of Alberta as an Assistant Professor. You can reach me at **ftstrabo@ucdavis.edu**.
