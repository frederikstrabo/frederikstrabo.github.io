IÂ am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Agricultural and Resource Economics department at the University of California, Davis.

As an environmental and natural resource economist, I am interested in evaluating environmental policies and land-use practices that mitigate the impacts of climate change. My dissertation focuses on how prescribed burns and mechanical biomass removals, commonly referred to as fuel treatments, reduce the cost of wildfires. While answering this question, my dissertation touches on the influence of ancillary environmental policies that negatively impact fuel treatments on public lands while exploring how such fuel treatments influence the values and incentives of adjacent private landowners. I am also interested in climate-ready commercial fisheries management and have a working paper that examines the distributional impacts of the West Coast Groundfish buyback program. 

Before Davis, I earned my M.A. in economics from the University of Southern California and a B.A. in economics and psychology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 

I am on the job market during the 2024-25 academic year. You can reach me at **ftstrabo@ucdavis.edu**
