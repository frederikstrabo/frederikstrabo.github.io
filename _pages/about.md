I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Agricultural and Resource Economics department at the University of California, Davis.

As an environmental and natural resource economist, I evaluate land-use practices and environmental policies aimed at mitigating the impacts of climate change and environmental degradation. My dissertation focuses on how prescribed burns and mechanical biomass removals, commonly known as fuel treatments, reduce the cost of wildfires. While addressing whether fuel treatments reduce wildfire costs, I also explore how ancillary environmental policies may unintentionally hinder these treatments on public lands and examine how public land fuel treatments influence the values and incentives of adjacent private landowners. I am also interested in climate-ready commercial fisheries management and have a working paper analyzing the distributional impacts of the West Coast Groundfish buyback program. 

Before joining UC Davis, I earned my M.A. in economics from the University of Southern California and a B.A. in economics and psychology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 

I am actively seeking academic positions during the 2024-25 academic year. You can reach me at **ftstrabo@ucdavis.edu**
