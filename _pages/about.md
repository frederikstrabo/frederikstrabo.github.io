My research interests lie at the intersection of natural resources and environmental economics. My dissertation explores the role of forest management practices in mitigating the economic costs of wildfires and climate-ready commercial fishery management.

Prior to Davis, I earned my M.A. in economics from the University of Southern California and a B.A. in economics and psychology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
