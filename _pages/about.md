I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Agricultural and Resource Economics department at the University of California, Davis.

As an environmental and natural resource economist, I study how land-use practices and environmental policies can mitigate the impacts of climate change and environmental degradation. My dissertation focuses on wildfire management, combining causal inference methods with high-resolution spatial data to show that fuel treatments such as prescribed burns and mechanical biomass removals generate substantial economic returns by reducing suppression costs, property loss, and smoke-related health impacts. I also examine how conservation policies and regulatory reforms shape forest management decisions, underscoring the trade-offs between ecosystem protection and climate resilience. Building on this work, I recently received a CAL FIRE grant to study how fuel treatments on public lands affect the values and incentives of neighboring private landowners.

Before joining UC Davis, I earned my M.A. in economics from the University of Southern California and a B.A. in economics and psychology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 

I am actively seeking academic positions during the 2024-25 academic year. You can reach me at **ftstrabo@ucdavis.edu**
