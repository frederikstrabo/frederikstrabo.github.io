I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Agricultural and Resource Economics department at the University of California, Davis. My research interests lie at the intersection of natural resource and environmental economics. I study how forest management practices, such as prescribed fires and mechanical thinning, can mitigate the economic costs of wildfires. I also study climate-ready commercial fishery management.

Prior to Davis, I earned my M.A. in economics from the University of Southern California and a B.A. in economics and psychology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

I am on the job market during the 2024-25 academic year. You can reach me at ftstrabo@ucdavis.edu
