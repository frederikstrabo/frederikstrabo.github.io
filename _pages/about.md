I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Agricultural and Resource Economics department at the University of California, Davis.

As an environmental and natural resource economist, I evaluate land-use practices and environmental policies aimed at mitigating the impacts of climate change and environmental degradation. My dissertation focuses on how prescribed burns and mechanical biomass removals, commonly known as fuel treatments, reduce the cost of wildfires. By analyzing the Northwest Forest Plan, I also highlight the importance of aligning environmental policies with broader ecosystem management goals in the face of a changing climate. This year, I secured a CAL FIRE grant to support a new project examining how public land fuel treatments influence the values and incentives of adjacent private landowners. 

Before joining UC Davis, I earned my M.A. in economics from the University of Southern California and a B.A. in economics and psychology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 

I am actively seeking academic positions during the 2024-25 academic year. You can reach me at **ftstrabo@ucdavis.edu**
