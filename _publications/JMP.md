***Abstract***:

In recent decades, the economic costs of wildfires have increased precipitously -- the 2018 California wildfire season alone resulted in a cumulative loss of $148.5 billion (Wang et al. 2021). This study explores the degree to which fuel treatments, commonly promoted by scientists as a way of reducing the costs from wildfires, are a chronically underfunded public good by measuring their impact on fire suppression costs. Because the location and extent of fuel treatments and fire suppression costs are not random, I instrument fuel treatments with Northern Spotted Owl critical habitat designations and Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) reserves. Results show that fires starting in the above-mentioned protected areas are less likely to occur close to fuel treatments and are of more significant size on average. I explore the robustness of such estimates by matching fires that ignite inside protected areas to fires occurring outside based on observable characteristics that influence fuel treatment and fire suppression activity. Results suggest that environmental protections have unintentionally increased fire risk on the landscape and correspondingly lead to higher fire suppression costs.
